As such, there is a large number of restaurants serving cuisines to satify any palette, and providing a dining experience from the very basic to the most exquisite.\nThis is also a great opportunity for someone to open a new restaurant. However, given the thriving restaurant scene, competition and a diverse population, it is challenging to find the best location for a restaurant and a particular cuisine.\n<br>In this project we will analyze this business case to find the best places for a new restaurant, by using available data for the existing restaurants and clustering the Dubai communities."
